# geojson

in the "test data structure" layer of our art map prototipe, I added the spot Centro Wilfredo Lam. I added tags in the description: #museum #surrealism. Then I tested out the conversion from kml into geojson to see where those tags are contained inside the data strucuture. It worked out well. Both tags now sit here in the "properties": {"description": "#museum #surrealism"}
